\section{Citing (indication of references in main text body)}

\subsection{Citing according to surname of author}

References are cited with the surname of author and year. In the references section, the references are listed alphabetically according to the surname of the author.

Citing of a reference at the beginning of or within a sentence must be as Boran (2003), whereas a citation at the end of a sentence must be as (Boran, 2003). The full-stop is placed directly after the citation.
 
A reference with two authors must be cited as Yılmaz and Johnson (2004) at the beginning of or within a sentence, or as (Yılmaz and Johnson, 2004) at the end of a sentence. 

A reference with more than two authors must be cited as Yılmaz et al. (2004) at the beginning of or within a sentence, or as (Yılmaz et al, 2004) at the end of a sentence. 

Different publications of an author published in the same year must be cited as Feray (2005a), Feray (2005b). 

While citing a part of a publication; the number of the page the cited material (chapter, table, figure, or equation) is on must be indicated. While citing, the expression “page” must be abbreviated, but “chapter” must not. For example; (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005, p. 10), (Shimamura, 1989, Chapter 3). 

Citing multiple publications in one pair of brackets; (Berndt, 2002; Harlow, 1983). 

Citing personal communication in main text body; (V.–G. Nguyen, personal communication, September 28, 1998), (J. Smith, personal communication, August 15, 2009).

In the references section, reference tags must be listed according to the surname of author. 

For citing of secondary references (In case the reference cites another reference), the secondary reference must be cited in brackets.  In the references section, the reference tag is organized according to the secondary reference, the original reference must not be used as a tag. For example; In his e-mails, Smith argued that asynchronous line dancing would be the next Internet meme (as cited in Jones, 2010).
